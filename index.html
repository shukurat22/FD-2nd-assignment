    <h1> Welcome to my 2nd assignment, it's great to see you!</h1>
    <p> Hi, my name is Shukurat Akanbi. A current trainee in the Glovo WIT Bootcmap. I am a product manager who is looking to explore the various opportunity in the tech space. I am also a blockchain/crypto enthusiast based in Lagos state, Nigeria. </p>


    <p> I am a graduate of the University of Ilorin with a BSC.(ED).Biology. I have also obtained certifications in Product management. In the course of the trainings, I have been able to gather and learn essential knowledge and skills required of a product manager such as the ability to analyze and make data driven decisions, conduct market research, lead and collaborate effectively with cross functional teams, and also solve complex challenges. </p>
<p> My aim in joining the Glovo WIT Bootcamp is to equip myself with the technical skills and in-depth knowledge essential for excelling as a Product Manager. By gaining hands on experience in coding and enhancing my ability to collaborate with technical teams, my aim is to bridge the gap between product vision and technical execution.</p>


<p> Thanks for visiting and come back soon.</p>
